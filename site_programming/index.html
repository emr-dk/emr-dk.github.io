      Hi! I'm really happy you found your way here to my site, and I hope you'll enjoy your time exploring it. You're probably here to discover my interests and expertise, so let me share what I'm passionate about. I specialize in computer-assisted analysis within the data science realm, with a particular focus on geographic data and GIS technologies. I'm actively pursuing AI work on the side and have substantial experience building and implementing AI solutions, especially around RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures, which I've developed as part of a tech startup. I thoroughly enjoy working with IT architecture and infrastructure, particularly spinning up nodes and offloading workloads to web workers for optimal performance. My expertise extends to advanced database usage, which has proven invaluable in my data science and data engineering endeavors. These professional areas have significantly enhanced my proficiency in Python and JavaScript, and I also have experience with various other programming languages including C# and Go. My primary domain has been the geographic space, working extensively with geodata and GIS systems, which aligns perfectly with my academic background in geography and geoinformatics. I have a genuine passion for statistics and bring a broad range of experience including in-depth work with statistical registers and econometrics. When I'm not immersed in technical work, I enjoy listening to music and playing the clarinet, which is my instrument of choice. I also dabble with a guitar which was my first instrument. I love cultural experiences such as attending the opera, theater, cinema, and visiting museums, and there's nothing quite like settling down with a good book to unwind from the hustle and bustle of modern life. In short i enjoy the following things GIS Data Science Geographic Data Analysis AI/Machine Learning RAG Architecture Python JavaScript C# Go Database Administration Data Engineering IT Architecture Infrastructure Management Web Workers Statistical Analysis Econometrics Statistical Registers Geoinformatics Geography Computer-Assisted Analysis Programming CSS Systems Music Books Opera Theater Cinema Museums Clarinet Guitar Cultural Experiences. I also have a summerhouse which I enjoy going to with my family, and I love spending time outdoors, especially in nature. I hope this gives you a good overview of who I am and what I do. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about any of these topics, feel free to reach out! Thanks for coming and I hope you'll continue to have an excellent day! Keep clicking through the sites and enjoy the content I have created. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always open to new ideas and discussions. Have a great time exploring my site and learning more about my work and interests! So the idea is to fill out the page but I really cant think of anything else to write right now. So... See you!
